# Python Mini Labs

This repository contains small Python projects I’m using to refresh
my scripting skills and rebuild consistent Git habits.

Each folder is a standalone mini lab with its own README.

## Approach
I  am intentionally keeping each project small and contained.
This helps me understand each piece and makes it easier to finish and iterate.

## Projects
1. log-checker – scans log files for common error keywords
